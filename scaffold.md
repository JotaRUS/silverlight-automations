Perfect.

Below is a massive, production-grade scaffold file for your first commit.

This file is not code — it is a system blueprint + execution contract + architecture declaration that Codex 5.3 High will read before entering planning mode.

It is intentionally extremely detailed so that:
	•	There is zero ambiguity.
	•	All modules are declared.
	•	All domain rules are fixed.
	•	All system invariants are defined.
	•	Codex cannot simplify scope.
	•	Codex cannot “interpret loosely”.
	•	Codex must build everything.

You will place this file at:

/docs/ARCHITECTURE_MASTER_SPECIFICATION.md

Commit this as the very first commit.

EXPERT SOURCING AUTOMATION PLATFORM

Master System Specification

Version 1.0
Status: Production Build
Authority: Signed Agreement (SECOND – SCOPE OF SERVICES)

⸻

1. SYSTEM PURPOSE

This system is a deterministic, queue-driven, multi-channel expert sourcing and outreach automation platform.

This is a production-grade commercial automation system.

This is NOT:
	•	A prototype
	•	A best-effort system
	•	A partial implementation
	•	A mock architecture
	•	A SaaS template
	•	An MVP

This system must be:
	•	Fully deterministic
	•	Fully functional
	•	Fully integrated
	•	Fully documented
	•	Fully testable
	•	Fully production-ready

After implementation, only environment variables and database migrations should be required.

⸻

2. TECHNOLOGY STACK (MANDATORY)

Backend:
	•	Node.js (LTS)
	•	TypeScript (strict mode enabled)
	•	Express or Fastify
	•	Prisma ORM
	•	PostgreSQL
	•	BullMQ (Redis-backed queue system)
	•	Zod validation
	•	Pino logger
	•	Dockerized
	•	ESLint + Prettier configured

AI:
	•	OpenAI API (low temperature deterministic logic)

Infrastructure assumptions:
	•	Redis required
	•	PostgreSQL required
	•	All external integrations must be production-ready

⸻

3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

System is divided into modules:

/src
  /api
  /modules
    /projects
    /job-title-engine
    /sales-nav
    /lead-ingestion
    /enrichment
    /cooldown
    /outreach
    /screening
    /ranking
    /call-allocation
    /call-validation
    /performance-engine
    /google-sheets-sync
  /queues
  /integrations
  /core
  /db
  /config

All modules must be independent, testable, and idempotent.

⸻

4. DOMAIN MODEL DECLARATION

Entities:

Project
Company
JobTitle
SalesNavSearch
Lead
Expert
ExpertContact
EnrichmentAttempt
OutreachThread
OutreachMessage
ScreeningQuestion
ScreeningResponse
CallTask
CallLog
Caller
CallerPerformanceMetric
RankingSnapshot
CooldownLog
GoogleSheetExport
SystemEvent

All relationships must be strictly enforced via foreign keys.

⸻

5. CORE SYSTEM INVARIANTS

These rules are absolute and must never be violated:
	1.	No expert may be contacted twice within 30 days unless override flag enabled.
	2.	All enrichment attempts must be logged.
	3.	All outbound messages must be stored.
	4.	All inbound replies must be stored.
	5.	Every call must be validated via Yay.com logs.
	6.	No call task may exist without associated expert.
	7.	No expert may be assigned to a caller outside their language + geography.
	8.	No caller may receive more than one task simultaneously.
	9.	If a caller misses execution window → immediate reallocation.
	10.	Project cannot stop sourcing until target threshold met.

⸻

6. JOB TITLE DISCOVERY ENGINE

	3.	Normalize titles
	4.	Deduplicate
	5.	Pass to OpenAI for expansion
	6.	Score relevance
	7.	Persist titles with score
	8.	Log AI reasoning

Output:
Validated job title list per project.

⸻

7. SALES NAVIGATOR INGESTION

Requirements:
	•	Minimum 1 URL per project
	•	URL validation
	•	Metadata extraction
	•	Pagination handling

⸻

8. ENRICHMENT ENGINE (MULTI-PROVIDER ORCHESTRATION)

	•	Wiza
	•	Forager
	•	Zeliq

	•	Datagm
	•	People Data Labs

Must implement:

Parallel + sequential strategy:

Step 1: Parallel enrichment batch
Step 2: Collect results
Step 3: Validate emails
Step 4: Validate phones
Step 5: Confidence scoring
Step 6: Fallback if below threshold

Must log:
	•	Provider used
	•	Attempt time
	•	Response
	•	Errors
